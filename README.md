RSS News Reader

This is a simple PHP file that fetches and parses about 140+ rss feeds from news websites in realtime, and displays the result. It also has a news filter, where you can filter on negative or positive news, the filter then sorts the news according to predetermined wordlists containing common words.

The RSS list was composed by @Dave Winer: https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists
